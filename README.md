The dataset I’ve gained includes the information about the safety and details of each part that makes an elevator a product. I aim to suggest the positive features and the issues the elevators have in New York City which is a great example as a city for researching purposes in the industry. The elevator information in New York gives a better vision about the industry in other major cities in North America. The data collection includes all electrical applications submitted to the Department of Buildings since December 11, 2017. The dataset obtained contains information regarding 35366 elevators and their 167 different variables. After improting the dataset into Python, I Cleansed the dataset utilizing advanced data cleaning techniques and imported into Tableau. Also, I Built multiple charts including pie charts to illustrate the condition of elevators in New City and compared them among the best sellers in the city. The dashboards included in the file clearly show the main points of the project with visually detailed information.
